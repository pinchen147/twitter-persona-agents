{# 
Base prompt template for tweet generation.

This Jinja2 template constructs the main prompt sent to the AI model for tweet generation.
It combines three key elements:
1. Persona: The account's personality and voice characteristics
2. Context chunks: Philosophical content from the knowledge base
3. Exemplars: Example tweets that demonstrate the desired style

Variables:
- persona: String containing the bot's personality description
- context_chunks: List of text chunks from vector search
- exemplars: List of example tweets with 'text' field

The prompt guides the AI to synthesize philosophical insights while maintaining
the account's unique voice and adhering to Twitter's constraints.
#}
{{ persona }}

Based on the following context from teachings on presence and shadow work, write a tweet that embodies this wisdom in your voice.

Context chunks:
{% for chunk in context_chunks %}
---
{{ chunk.text }}
---
{% endfor %}

Style examples (notice the tone and approach):
{% for exemplar in exemplars %}
- "{{ exemplar.text }}"
{% endfor %}

Guidelines:
- Keep it under 280 characters
- Use line breaks to create natural pauses and emphasis
- Break longer thoughts into digestible chunks with empty lines between them
- Speak to what's actually happening in people's lives
- Be present-focused but not preachy
- Include some edge or challenge alongside compassion
- Use simple, clear language
- Don't be overly mystical or abstract
- Avoid spiritual bypassing - acknowledge the human struggle

Generate a single tweet that feels fresh and authentic, drawing wisdom from the context while maintaining your unique voice:
